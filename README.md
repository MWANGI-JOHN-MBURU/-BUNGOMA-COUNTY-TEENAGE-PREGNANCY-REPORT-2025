## Observations & Implications
Access to Education Programs and Contraceptives is relatively high (~65% for both), yet the dropout rates remain concerning, especially in Mt. Elgon and Bumula.

Geographical Disparity: Certain wards and sub-counties exhibit significantly higher dropout numbers, suggesting localized socio-economic or cultural issues.

Targeted Intervention: Villages like Sango, Makhonge, and Matisi may need more focused interventions.

## Recommendations
Strengthen Education Programs: Expand outreach to areas with lower access and reinforce sexual and reproductive health education.

Improve Health Services: Ensure consistent access to contraceptives across all sub-counties.

Community Engagement: Work with local leaders to address stigma and raise awareness.

Data-Driven Interventions: Use ward- and village-level data to deploy targeted support services.

Monitoring and Evaluation: Establish a system for tracking teenage pregnancy trends and evaluating the impact of programs.

## Conclusion
Teenage pregnancy remains a significant challenge in Bungoma County, particularly in areas like Mt. Elgon and Bumula. While there is reasonable access to education and contraceptive programs, more localized and community-specific interventions are needed to reduce school dropouts and support affected teenagers.
